    "text": "It is my intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.\n\nIn-Class Quizzes\nIn-Class quizzes are opportunity to practice as you are learning during the lectures. The questions will be asked sporadically throughout the lectures. You can discuss quiz questions with your neighbors in class, check notes, use internet etc. You will be graded for participation, not for correctness. You need to be attending the lecture and respond to all questions in order to receive the participation point. If you are not participating in lecture or have someone else participate for quizzes on your behalf, this will be considered academic misconduct. Note that during week zero we will have online quizzes which will be graded for correctness.\n\n\nHomework Assignments\nAfter weekly topics are completed you will be assigned a homework on these topics. You will have until 11:00 am on Wednesdays to finish the homework assignments. For homework assignments, you can use books and notes, talk to other people in your class, use online resources including generative AI however there are some limitations. See ?@sec-ai.\nTLDR; Use tools or people to help you learn BUT acknowledge in detail how this helped your learning.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nMidterm exam will be held in-person, in-class on on Oct 29 during lecture time. You will work individually on the exam. It will be a closed-book exam but you will be given equations. You will not need a calculator and you will not be allowed to use one.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nFinal exam will be held in-person, on Fri, Dec 12 at 8:00-10:00am for Lecture A and on Mon, Dec 8 at 1:30-3:30pm. You will work individually on the exam. It will be a closed-book exam but you will be given equations. You will not need a calculator and you will not be allowed to use one."

    "text": "Late work is not accepted except for homework assignments. Every student will be excused ONCE up to 48 hours late submission. You do not need to email the reader (aka grader) about this. For students who have already used their late submission excuse once, then the following late penalty will apply.\nOn homework assignments if the submission is later than the due date and time, then 25% of the achieved total grade will be deducted for every 12 hours that the submission is late. For example, if you were to get 12 points out of 15 on a homework assignment and you submitted 15 hours late then your score would be 6 points. It is recommended that you start working on the homework early and not leave it until the last minute to avoid any technological or personal issues. Starting early would also give you ample opportunity to attend office hours.\nIt is possible that during the quarter, other events may affect your learning. This can be but not limited to sickness, religious holiday, attending a conference, playing professional sports, feeling down, flat tire, roommate issues, canceled/delayed flight, wanting to/needing to travel, or any other reason you can think of. In such cases, you will be excused from two in-class quizzes with no questions asked. You do not need to email me about it. You should still use the course materials online and office hours to catch on the content that you have missed. I would advise you to be mindful of that there are only 2 excused allowances for missing the quizzes. That already makes up about 10% of the quarter. Anything beyond 2 excused absences will be assigned zero. If you have an event going in your life that impacts your learning more than a week then I would advise you to talk to me (without waiting for the end of the quarter) to discuss your options. It’s best to discuss such high impact events during office hours.\nMidterm and final exam are required components of the class and cannot be excused. For any needs regarding these assignments you can discuss it with me in a timely manner."

For all assignments other than the final, you have one-week after receiving feedback and grade from us to ask for regrading to correct any errors. For the final exam, you will have 24 hours to request regrading. For assignments on Gradescope you can send regrade requests directly within Gradescope. For others, you can email Samahriti Mukherjee and add me to CC field of the email. Note that the grade on Canvas Gradebook will be the official grade and you should check for its correctness."
